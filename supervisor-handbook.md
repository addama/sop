# Supervisor Handbook {#top}

## Purpose {#purpose}

The purpose of this document is to prepare and inform supervisors, mentors, and leaders in the organization so that their approaches to supervision, as well as any processes used, are coming from the same place. 

The document describes the theoretical aspects of supervision and leadership, then the specific implementation of those concepts in the form of processes and recommended behaviors and actions.




## Scope {#scope}

The targets of this document are any new and existing employees of Xtract Solutions that have direct reports, or are commonly looked to for mentorship regardless of whether they have any subordinates.

## Sources of Power {#power}

*Power*, as relevant here, is described by psychologists John French and and Bertram Raven as having the potential to exercise social influence, and to be an agent of change based on the type and depth of power granted to both positive and negative effect.

According to French and Raven, there are 6 bases of power:

* *Coercive*: The ability to use force to gain compliance
  * "I'll beat you up!"
  * "You're fired if you don't shape up by the end of the week!"
* *Reward*: The ability to give something desireable to gain compliance
  * "I'll give everyone a raise if this project finishes this month!"
  * "You did a great job with that, and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate it"
* *Legitimate*: Power given by your title, the nature of your position, or some cultural or social norm
  * "The boss said to do it, so we do it."
  * "You saved my life, so now I owe you one."
* *Referent*: Power through affiliation, shared background, or other social/familial ties
  * "Grandma is the matriarch of the family."
  * "I let the pastor have first dibs on the cookie plate."
* *Expert*: Power through expertise, because you're the only one who can do it, or you have the most experience
  * "She's done this before and is the best bet to help us now."
  * "I have a doctorate in economics; I know what I'm talking about."
* *Informational*: Knowing something that others want to know
  * "I'll give you the nuclear launch codes if you listen to my demands."
  * "In the next few days, I'm going to be giving you a new project..."

Being appointed as a supervisor, or selected as a mentor, is a grant of power to you. It is up to you to use that power effectively and with good intention - essentially, to be a good leader. No, you might not be at the head of the army, leading the charge with your saber raised; but your personality, choices, and behaviors do greatly influence others who rely on you for the power you wield - and, you'll find, even people over whom you don't have power. Any amount of power must be used appropriately, and that's where leadership comes in.

You will use each of these sources of power in some quantity throughout your career; though, hopefully not *coercive* power quite as much as the others. Your ability to be a leader at all stems from the *legitimate power* granted to you by the company by making you a supervisor. Being able to give someone time off or a bonus or raise, or something socially valuable like praise is an example of *reward power*. You are likely in this position in the first place because of your *expert power* arising from your experience and history.

While this is getting into the minutiae of managerial psychology, and is not strictly useful to most people, it *is* important that you understand that your power can be used in many ways, and comes from many places - some negative, some positive. The examination of these power sources illuminates the need for regulation - for good leadership qualities - in those that have those powers.





## Leadership Qualities {#leadership-qualities}

A lot has been written about the qualities a leader must or may have; if you have interest in the body of work, it really is enlightening and goes as far back as there has been people to lead. For example, in Greek and subsequent leadership theories, leaders are *born* - that is, if you weren't born with the qualities of a good leader, you could never achieve the greatness of those who did. While this "great man" theory still persists, it has largely been supplanted (or supplemented) with an understanding of what those qualities mean, as opposed to their simple existence or non-existence in a person, and how they can be cultivated. 

I categorize the qualities of leadership in three ways: *interpersonal skills*, *personal authenticity*, and *sound judgement*. Having positive qualities in these three categories, and actively educating and improving yourself in them broadly will have a noticeable effect on your impact as a leader and mentor. These qualities help you express yourself in a leadership capacity, and go hand-in-hand with being good at your job, being respected by your peers, etc.

### Interpersonal Skills {#interpersonal-skills}

**Interpersonal Skills** are your ability and willingness to communicate and operate with other people. Your ability to speak, to be heard, to say what you mean and be understood, to empathize with others, and for them to want to empathize with you are all desireable interpersonal skills. You could excel in all other areas, but being unable to communicate effectively or in a way that makes people want to listen, your subordinates will not understand your vision and will view you as awkward, rude, or dumb.

Important interpersonal skill qualities include:

* *Rhetoric*: the ability to speak fluently on any topic, to hold a conversation, and to argue effectively
* *Flexibility*: gracefully dealing with differences between you and those around you, or as a mediator between the differences in others
* *Compassion*: being able to empathize with others, to think from other perspectives, and to understand emotional reactions
* *Charisma*: your ability to appeal to others on a non-logical level, to have your ideas, presence, and vision welcome and desired
* *Eloquence*: the aesthetic brother of rhetoric, the ability to speak beautifully, to express your ideas in ways that make them memorable and attractive 

### Personal Authenticity {#personal-authenticity}

**Personal Authenticity** is the measure of how "pure" your representation of yourself is to the outside world. Great and memorable leaders are often remembered for their whole being, their expression, their decision making style, their fashion, their habits, their phrases and sayings. This is an expression of self-confidence, self-reflection, emotional intelligence, self-acceptance, and self-empowerment. And a healthy dose of ego, besides! You could excel in all other areas, but being an uncertain, wishy-washy, bland, dependent, vapor of a person robs your vision of gravitas and importance, and makes your mentorship less potent, less desireable.

More than sexy concepts like gravitas and ego, a leader who serves as a beacon of self-acceptance and empowerment engenders those things in their subordinates. This strong, self-aware, confident leadership has the power to bring people up from bad places.

Important personal authenticity qualities include:

* *Self-confidence*: the certainty with which you present yourself and your ideas, and the ability to make a decision and be confident enough to accept the consequences
* *Self-reflection*: a measure of internal searching to better understand yourself, how you act, your problems, and what you're best at
* *Emotional Intelligence*: an understanding of the range of your emotions, how they affect you, and what you can do with those energies
* *Self-acceptance*: being comfortable with yourself, your decisions, how you look, what you do
* *Self-empowerment*: independence, the confidence to know that you *can* make the decisions you make, to wield the power you do
* *Ego*: The persistent voice in your brain that says "what about me?" and causes you to seek bigger and better things

### Sound Judgement {#sound-judgement}

**Sound Judgement** is the reflection of your decision-making, logical thinking, ethics, and morals. Much of the work of a leader is in the deliberation and delivery of decisions, and is often one of the major differences between you and those below you - the power to choose, and to have your choice carry forward into the future for everyone. 

Being unable to make sound decisions, either by being unethical, immoral, uninformed, or flippant, marks you as untrustworthy of that power. You could excel in all other areas, but being unable to demonstrate sound judgement will render your choices and decisions questionable at best, and open you up to your subordinates (and your own supervisor) to not trust in your ability to lead *at all.* 

Remember, especially with newer employees, how you make decisions, and the ethics and morals you employ, will be passed down to your subordinates and influence them in sometimes very subtle ways. *Forever.* 

Important sound judgement qualities include:

* *Decision-making*: your ability to view and understand a situation, weigh the options, and to develop a vision with definitive and informed decisions
* *Logical thinking*: to make choices and actions unclouded by bias or emotion
* *Ethics*: adhering to professionalism and the rules and expectations levied on us as a business, or the unwritten rules of social interaction
* *Morals*: understanding the difference between right and wrong, to know the impacts of both, and, generally, to prefer actions that are *good*

### Supervisor vs Leader vs Mentor {#supervisor-leader-mentor}

Leadership, supervision, and mentorship are closely entwined. 

* Leadership is **what you do with power**, and how you express that power to others. 
* Supervision **is a power** given to you by the company to influence and guide others' day-to-day work and career progression, as well as to assist in personal troubles and interpersonal conflicts. 
* Mentorship **is a power** that others give to you because they seek your experience, your stability, your conscience, your ability to decide, your ability to be objective. 

As supervision and mentorship are both grants of power, you must necessarily exercise good leadership acumen to make effecive use of those powers, no matter how small or temporary.

Notice the difference between supervision and mentorship - one is granted by the company, while the other is granted by another person. Supervision does not necessarily mean mentorship, though that is often implied by the relationship or developed over time. People *choose* their mentors because they respect them, usually, or simply need someone with an outside point of view. As a supervisor, it is helpful to be able to provide mentorship as it allows you to further express your vision and shape your mentee into a successful employee.






## Expectations

Expectations management plays a huge role in providing structure and morale regulation. While it's not a topic often talked about, I feel that predicting, setting, managing, and acting on expectations is a skill that every leader should seek to master.

The expectations we have and hold on to shape how we react to our environment and other people. It's easy to create expectations out of nothing, and just as easy to hold on to those expectations even when they've proven to be incorrect. Part of your power as a leader is creating and managing these expectations so that there is no disconnect between reality and what your subordinates think is happening.

Expectations can be:

* *Unspoken*: assumed requirements and knowledge that just come with the action, role, event, or place
* *Assumed*: based on how things go, people often assume things will go a certain way, thereby creating expectation
* *Explicit*: requirements and knowledge that are specifically laid out and placed on a person, role, or place

*Unspoken expectations* are those assumptions that we make because they are universal, and we can make them because we have come to expect them to be true. Unspoken expectations are often the worst ones to break, the most awkward to remediate, and the easiest ones to monitor.

Unspoken expectations include:

* You are here to do work as outlined in your job role
* You will maintain a regular and reasonable schedule
* You will seek guidance if you need it
* You will act, dress, write, and speak professionally
* You will wash your clothes and take showers
* You will not commit illegal acts, or do anything to put yourself, your coworkers, or the business in danger 
* You will not play favorites
* You will self-regulate your well-being and health

*Assumed expectations* often happen when our brains pick up on patterns in what's happening, and try to guess what's next. Sometimes, an expectation is assumed because it's an unspoken rule that this follows that - but much of the time, it's just what we want or fear will happen. These kinds of expectations, when breached, are the most impacting to morale.

Examples of assumed expectations include:

* We've been dating for 1 year, so he'll propose soon
* I've had negative feedback on my last 2 reviews, so I'll be fired soon
* I have been praised for my work, and promotions are coming up, so I'm likely to be promoted
* It's a Friday afternoon, so traffic will be particularly bad

*Explicit expectations* are laid out in clear terms and presented as facts. These are used to provide structure, metrics, and boundaries, and most often include simple requirements put on people and roles. They are often expectations placed on someone, rather than internally generated - in either case, the effect is the same: the expectation is internalized, and carried forward as their own. These kinds of expectations are easiest for subordinates to ignore or break without feeling too badly, and must be reiterated and reenforced so that they have value. 

Examples of explicit expectations include:

* You will work from 0900 to 1700 and show up 15 minutes early
* You will wear a suit on Mondays
* You must make at least 6 calls an hour, and 30 sales per day
* You will attend one seminar or class per quarter that is relevant to your job
* You will be certified within three months of hire

### Managing Expectations

Managing expectations can be difficult, because we only have direct control over one type - explicit - while the others come and go internally, sometimes for what seems like no good reason. These expectations affect how people go about their work and interactions, and as such, even the illusive expectations need to be sought out and squashed (or affirmed) in order to better control mood and morale.

The best course of action for managing expectations is transparency, honesty, and swift action. Being transparent in your dealings has many benefits:

* Fostering an environment of transparency will signal to others that they should ask before they assume
* Many people are unaware of the assumptions they are making, and how it shapes their behavior. Being able to cut right to the heart of these expectations can be illuminating
* Being known for transparency and honesty opens the door for you to ask those questions and squash those sometimes deep-rooted assumptions without it being awkward or unwanted

Try to periodically view your work situation from the top-down, looking for any break points, events, relationships, or other factors that may cause your subordinates (or your own boss!) to create expectations. Are you also making assumptions that might be baseless? If you see these things pop up, get on them as quickly as possible. While some assumptions may have a net positive, it's better to acknowledge them and risk popping that bubble rather than letting a negative assumption fester.

Common expectations management factors include:

* Someone doing well but not having their success acknowledged may assume their work isn't good enough
* While you try and help one subordinate with a particularly grievous problem, others may assume you are playing favorites or giving special attention
* Assumptions about raises and promotions crop up at the end of the year, whether there was a plan for those things or not
* Helping someone out once may create the assumption that you'll help them out in a similar way again, when you were trying to give them the tools they need to succeed on their own
* Placing an explicit expectation on a person may cause them to assume you place that expectation on everyone, but it's only because they are deficient in that area and need more structure (or are great, and need encouragement to grow more!)

### Expectations Go In All Directions

The expectations game is not just about what you expect of your subordinate, and what they assume will happen in the future. Expectations and assumptions flow from all people, in all directions.

* You expect to be paid in exchange for your work
* The company expects you to put in your best effort in exchange for money
* Your subordinates expect that you know what you're doing and are in your position because you earned it
* Our clients expect that we have their best interests at heart
* Your boss expects you to keep control of your people and their output

As a leader, it is useful to you to seek out and understand the expectations that are levied against you so that you can manage them. Know that there are tons of effects that come with your role and how you conduct yourself, like the wake from a boat. Being able to craft your public perception and how people predict your behavior is a boon to being a reliable, charismatic, and dependable leader.

### ... Until Proven Otherwise

All expectations come with a silent attachment: "... until proven otherwise." 

* "I expect that you will show up on time, *until you prove otherwise.*"
* "I assume you are in your position because you earned it, *until I find out otherwise.*"
* "I'm going to be promoted, *unless I'm not worthy.*"

These breakpoints are what causes much of the stress associated with expectations and assumptions. What's worse is that the more vague and subjective the assumption is, the harder that *or else* tends to hit. It's important that you be aware of these breakpoints and address them swiftly whenever feasible. 

Relevant to you is to establish an environment where expectations you breach can be called out in a constructive way. The higher you value your own commitments, the more your subordinates will value their own. Similarly, the more open you are to criticism, the more open they will be when they're on that side of the conversation. 







# Processes {#processes}

## Feedback {#feedback}

The feedback process is the official, written-down method for delivering expectations, mentorship, praise, and corrections. While those processes may happen informally on a day-to-day basis, feedback sessions are structured and try to sum up all of the progress and events that happened since the last one. 

Feedback consists of private, scheduled one-on-one meetings between the supervisor and supervisee. These happen on a schedule, and can be supplemented by ad-hoc meetings as needed. The process is kicked off by an Initial Feedback session, in which expectations are laid out for both parties, personalities and preferences are discussed, and a plan for the future is made. All subsequent feedback sessions are built on the foundation laid by the Initial Feedback, so it will generally require more preparation and time.

Alongside the official feedback process, it should be understood that you will have other feedback, mentorship, and correctional opportunities - these are separate from your scheduled feedback sessions and can be conducted however you see fit. 

### Importance of a Feedback Process {#feedback-importance}

Having and following a feedback process has numerous benefits, and are more than just a vehicle for corrections to behavior.

**Having frequent one-on-one exposure to others increases positive feelings and behaviors.** Studies have shown that frequent intimate or personal exposure to other people and ideas increases feelings of empathy, open-mindedness, and understanding. If you are also a beacon of these and other positive qualities, that is all the more strong an effect.

**More opportunities to acknowledge even the smallest of problems and accomplishments can lead to better overall processes, work environment, and mood.** Most people appreciate even small gestures of acknowledgement when they do good things, and most people would likely prefer to be corrected on a small issue rather than have a confrontation about something larger. By frequently having opportunities to make those gestures and corrections, the bad ones never grow into larger problems, and the small accomplishments are reenforced, blooming into further success. Additionally, ideas and improvements can be brought up more often, and in a more accepting environment, resulting in innovation.

**For some, the reliability of scheduled meetings provides structure for the rest of their time.** Many people, though not all, desire structure in their day-to-day tasks but find it difficult to have the willpower to create that structure themselves. By providing a reliable anchor with regularly scheduled feedbacks, you provide them with a super-structure from which they can build their own daily or weekly structures.

**For many, stress is never released because they simply don't have anyone to talk to.** Having an outlet for negative thoughts and feelings, or just uncertainty, can be tremendously beneficial to just about anyone. It will be up to the subordinate to know whether they are comfortable with that kind of sharing, but nevertheless you will be providing it to them. After all, being able to relieve tension, stress, and confusion by simply talking about it has a whole profession and billions of dollars of research put into it over thousands of years.

### The Difference Between Communication and Feedback {#difference-communication-feedback}

Not all communication is worthy of a feedback session, and not everything said in a feedback session is official and serious. 

Simple corrections or congratulations can most often be accomplished by just telling them what you want them to know without the need for a private meeting. Private meetings are useful for discussing potentially embarrassing things, and for allowing you or your subordinate to talk about private things that others simply don't need to be a part of. Official feedback sessions are also the correct time and place to discuss promotions, discipline, layoffs, and other business-related concerns that will affect their career.

Use your best judgement to determine whether a one-on-one private meeting is necessary.

### Feedback Process {#feedback-process}

The feedback process consists of 3 types of feedback sessions, each with a different purpose and scheduling.

* Initial Feedback - given when you first become someone's supervisor
* Scheduled Followups - given on a regular schedule to provide feedback regularly
* Requested Followups - given when needed by either party

#### Initial Feedback {#initial-feedback}

The **Initial Feedback** should happen as quickly as possible when gaining new subordinates. In this feedback session, you and your subordinate introduce yourselves and establish your personalities, your wants, your needs, and personal expectations. 

Prior to the session, I feel that it's important to create and prepare a well-thought-out document that serves as an agenda as well as providing all of your expectations in writing so that they can be referred to later. I print them out and have the paper present at every subsequent meeting so I can write new things/changes as they come up over time. Periodically, then, I update the electronic copy and print out a new version.

It's important to be flexible during the initial feedback - what you prepared to talk about may soon become irrelevant, or incredibly salient, based on how your conversation goes. Remember, you and your subordinate both have expectations that need to be established during this meeting.

Topics to discuss during an initial feedback could include:
* What is expected of them to be successful in the role
* Basics like hours, vacation, holidays, dress code, culture
* Concerns about the job, the team, the company
* Work history
* If they have areas they want to work on, or skills to learn
* 5 year plan, any short term plans
* Medical, religious, or cultural needs
* Disclosure of personal matters that will affect work performance, if they are comfortable
* How often they would like regular feedbacks

#### Scheduled Followups {#scheduled-followups}

**Scheduled Followups** are scheduled immediately after finishing the initial feedback based on a schedule that you both are comfortable with. By scheduled, I mean that in the literal sense: decide on a frequency and put it on the calendar. The most frequent should be per week, and most infrequent should be per month. Feedbacks quicker than a week are generally not helpful and end up being a waste of time; longer than a month between feedbacks means you lose out on valuable opportunities for feedback and improvement. 

During these sessions, you will discuss what has happened since the last session, bringing up both positive and negative events and behaviors. When possible, get their side of the story, and offer your own observations and solutions/mentorship. This is also an opportunity to reinforce the expectations you laid out in the initial feedback, and to change what those are as your relationship grows. 

Even if you have negative things to talk about, there is no reason that a feedback session should be overall negative. Look for ways to appraise good behaviors, to look on the bright side of things, and to offer personal anecdotes and stories to help them out. 

These sessions are also your opportunity to seek feedback from them so that you can better provide them with what they need or correct any poor behavior on your part. Open that door early and often to foster a more open sense of communication.

#### Requested Followups {#requested-followups}

**Requested Followups** are ad-hoc sessions conducted at the request of either you or your subordinate. Generally these will be shorter, or deal with issues that are strongly important in the moment. It's important that you be flexible and available for ad-hoc sessions, and to do the math on scheduling - are they regularly asking for requested feedback sessions? Would they benefit, even if only temporarily, from having more frequent scheduled feedbacks?

Use this kind of feedback to address grievous issues, to acknowledge and reenforce positive behaviors, and inquire into their mood if they seem off or like they need help. 








## Discipline {#discipline}

In my experience, actual discipline is rarely, if ever, required; prompt, transparent, honest, and freely-flowing communication smooths over most problems before they ever become discipline-worthy. I wouldn't feel right beginning a section on discipline without that caveat, as I have always felt that discipline is a **last-resort** aimed only at those who will not learn or grow without it. If no one ever has to read this section of this document, I will be happy.

Additionally, it is important that management see a disciplinary process as a way to rehabilitate, **not** to punish, censure, or remove. 

The important aspects of a disciplinary process is that it is:

* Progressive
* Fair to the individual
* Fair to the group

A **progressive** disciplinary process has well-defined, incremental stages of discipline, alongside a plan for moving between them. This allows management to address problems with the correct level of response - you don't kill a fly with a nuke, after all. The rules governing how to apply or move between steps allow for a more flexible and comprehensive plan. It is important to acknowledge that in some situations, moving up to a more severe disciplinary step might not be the best course of action; on the other hand, some actions and behaviors are so grievous that starting at the beginning would not be effective.

A disciplinary process that is **fair to the individual** provides ample time and resources for them to correct their behavior, and a transparent and understandable manner for communicating their infractions, avenues, and metrics for success. If they don't think they can come out successfully, why would they even try? If their success in changing their behavior can't be measured or acknowledged, how do they (or you) know when they've paid their dues?

By **fair to the group**, it means that there are no exceptions, and that all people are held to the same standards. All employees must know the disciplinary process and how it applies to them, and all employees must be held accountable to it at the same level, speed, and severity. Any exceptions will be seen as favoritism or abuse of power, which devalues the entire process.

### The Importance of Progressive Discipline {#discipline-importance}

**Establishing a disciplinary process can influence your subordinate's behavior on its own** - it provides clear guidelines on what will happen if they screw up, and helps to define the threshold where a "screwup" has happened. Having progressively severe responses can also help to deter poor behaviors, if only because they don't want the next step to happen to them.

**Progressively more severe responses and punishments also provides an avenue for remediation.** Not every transgression needs to end in a firing, after all. For some people, it may be more effective to have multiple verbal warnings before continuing, especially if the problem is hard to understand or solve. On the other hand, if a problem is grievous enough, being able to contextualize the response severity can help the offender to understand that what they did was wrong based on how much you're willing to punish them for it. Obviously, this should be reserved for only the most severe of corrections, but it can be a powerful tool.

Additionally, it is good to have discrete steps along a path so that the employee has time between them to plan and execute ways to change their behavior or understand their actions. 

Overall, we as managers want to have more lenient/light options at our disposal, that way discipline can be delivered in a progressive way without serious action that might harm employee or team morale and fitness. Groups of people are negatively affected when one of their members is punished, and that effect can make subtle but long-term damage to group morale and perception.

### The Difference Between Feedback and Discipline {#difference-feedback-discipline}

Just as there is a difference between normal communication and feedback, there is a fairly large difference between feedback and discipline. Feedback is a constructive, on-going effort to communicate acknowledgement, correction, care, expectations, and plans. Discipline is a process that is activated when an expectation has not been met through ignorance or malicious intent despite feedback attempts. It is an expression of a threshold, passing a line in the sand. In short, correcting a performance or behavior issue is just feedback - it's only discipline if feedback hasn't worked.

To put it another way, feedback has no end-game. It is a continuous stream of communication aiming for betterment of any kind across the board. Discipline represents the hard line that separates the supervisor from the supervisee, and is entirely transactional. You bought this penalty with your behavior, even though there have been documented attempts on my part to convince you that it's not worth the price. 

### The Right to Appeal {#right-to-appeal}

Even in a disciplinary process, collaborative and compassionate practices must prevail. The *right to appeal* is an expression of that, and provides the the guarantee that even the guilty may speak their mind, tell their story, and have their side listened to and considered.

At any given step in the process, the employee must be allowed (i.e. told specifically of their ability) to formally rebut the discipline given to them before any disciplinary action takes place. This rebuttal must be considered, and, if necessary, a counter-rebuttal may be made. 

If you never tell your employees that they have the right to appeal, reasoning that they should just "educate themselves," your "fairness" will forever be in air quotes. If the rebuttals are or have the appearance of being never read or considered, your "compassion" will forever be in air quotes. Likewise, if all it takes to get off the hook is to apologize in writing, your "justice" will forever be in air quotes.

### Progressive Discipline Process {#discipline-process}

Progressive discipline consists of these steps:

1. **Verbal warning**
  * A specific and direct warning that their behavior is inappropriate, and if possible, how to remediate the behavior
  * Discuss methods for change
  * Done in private
  * Offer the chance to argue their case through conversation
  * Behavior must be changed in: **2 weeks**
2. **Informal meeting**
  * A feedback session specifically aimed at exploring the bad behavior or action, what to do about it, and what consequences there will be if it is continued
  * In-depth discussion of methods for change and formulation of a plan
  * Offer the chance to argue their case either in writing or conversation
  * Behavior must be changed in: **1 month**
3. **Formal reprimand**
  * A formal, written reprimand that is stored by the supervisor and passed up the chain
  * Reflect on any suggested but failed or ignored plans for positive change, and come up with more, possibly stricter solutions
  * Delivered in private
  * Offer the chance to argue their case in writing
  * Behavior must be changed in: **2 weeks**
4. **Formal meeting**
  * A formal meeting between the employee, their supervisor, and either the supervisor's supervisor and/or HR
  * Go over any previous written reprimands and rebuttals, as well as prior plans
  * Offer the chance to argue their case in writing
  * Let the employee know that this is the last step before penalties and punishments occur
  * Behavior must be changed: **immediately**
5. **Penalties**
  * May include removal, disqualification, or lessening of any perks or benefits that are legally reduceable in that way
  * Penalties are applied by HR or other higher up at a formal meeting (like Step 4 above)
  * Example penalties: pay docking, ineligible for promotion, suspension, demotion, mandatory counseling, etc
  * Continue to plan remediation methods, looking more toward outside resources like counseling, rehab, re-training, etc, as necessary
  * Behavior must be changed in: **1 month**
6. **Termination**
  * Before termination, an investigation is held internally by impartial members to determine if the termination is fair
  * Distinguish between two reasons for termination: failure to comply, and termination for cause
  * Termination is carried out by HR or other higher up
  * After termination, an investigation is held to determine if there are risks of this happening more, or were worsened by mis-management
  
Some observations:

* This process, if the employee cannot or refuses to change, takes roughly 1 quarter (3-4 months) to execute from top to bottom
* At each step, the employee is offered the chance to rebut either in conversation, writing, or both, depending on severity
* Once higher-up managers and/or HR are involved, the supervisor is no longer solely in control of the process
* A discrete timeline is given in which the behavior must show appreciable change (or for isolated incidents, for them to not happen again) before the next step happens
* All corrections, meetings, penalties, and terminations are conducted in private

Reasons for termination are:

* **Failure to comply**: despite the best efforts of all involved, the employee was unable or unwilling to change behavior or actions that are deemed negative or counterproductive
* **Termination for cause**: the employee did something bad enough that their fit in the company is no longer tolerable, and/or they have committed severe legal violations or felonies





# Day-To-Day Basics

## Scheduling

Time and calendar keeping is one of the pillars of structure that people need in order to work efficiently and with low stress. A full calendar might be stressful, but an empty, unknown, and chaotic calendar is worse.

Aspects of time keeping that you will need to help with include:

* **Setting work hours, and the exceptions/rules for changing them.** While flexible schedules have been shown to be more effective for worker performance and happiness, that flexibility must still be based on some standard, otherwise it's impossible to control. 
  * A work day is 8 hours long, *plus* one optional hour for lunch
  * A work day consists of 6 *core hours* during which everyone must be present regardless of their schedule differences, leaving an hour of flex time on either end of the day
  * Any change to scheduling must be cleared by the employee's supervisor, even if it's reasonable and within the established rules
  * Temporary scheduling changes must be put on the calendar if possible
  * It is (generally) okay for someone to come in late - they will be expected to make up the time at the end of their day
  * Keep track of repeated breaches of good schedule keeping (frequently sleeping in, not staying the whole day, neglecting to notify supervisor of changes) and bring them up during feedback
  * You don't get to say no to hospital, dental, funeral, physical therapy, and other externally directed appointments - though you may try to negotiate rescheduling (some of) them if there is a great need

* **Approving, monitoring, and suggesting vacations.** As a supervisor, you will likely be the one approving vacations, and will need to keep on top of how many people you can lose at any given time (e.g. during the holidays) and whether or not you can lose specific people (e.g. when they have something only they can do). 
  * The default stance on vacation is *yes*; *maybe* if they have already taken over 2 weeks of vacation this year; *can we reschedule?* if something important is happening; and *no* if it's obvious they're taking vacation to get out of responsibilities
  * Keep a bird's eye view of the calendar, especially on holidays. Approving one person's vacation may unsettle a delicate skeleton crew rotation, and may require negotiation
  * Be aware of employees who haven't taken vacation in a long time - this is not healthy behavior. You are not given 2 weeks of vacation to be nice to you, you are given 2 weeks because that has been shown to be a healthy amount of time, albeit a minimum, that you should spend away from work in order to maintain good balance. Suggest or enforce vacations where you see it is needed

* **Monitoring calendars with respect to workload.** Many people have trouble balancing their commitments versus the amount of time they have to execute those commitments. This is often exacerbated in creative/constructive fields like ours where things can take wildly longer or shorter than we expect at first glance.
  * Actively question commitments such as meetings, self-selected work tasks, vacations, ensuring that they know how much they're taking on and don't have any conflicts
  * Learn your subordinates' workload habits - for some, having a full schedule is structure that they desire; for others, they simply don't know how to manage time. Help those that need it
  * Defend your subordinate's right to ask for rescheduling or disclusion from commitments, where possible. Trust but verify their take on the necessary-ness of their meetings, and empower them to know the limits of their schedule
  * If you notice a schedule or the reported activity during an amount of time is lacking, find out why, and provide something to do durin that time
  
## Work Distribution

While this is more a team lead or technical lead duty, supervision in a small company often involves some measure of team management. One of the things that keeps a team running smoothly is a controlled and efficient distribution of work.

In order to effectively distribute work, you must:

* Be aware of everyone's schedules
* Be aware of everyone's individual capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses
* Be aware of who "has always done it," and why
* Be aware of those who shouldn't do it, and why

Using this information, you can assign or re-assign work across your team. There is a delicate balancing act between who is the best person for the work and who has the time to do it. Sometimes it will be easy, and the majority of work tasks should be doable by anyone on your team, but you will still need to actively manage work distribution for those times when a difficult/nice task, or tight schedule comes up.

Things to consider when distributing work:

* If someone has the skills, but not the time, weigh the time/effort needed to train someone else versus the time to complete the task
* Actively look for holes in your team's capabilities, and assign individuals or groups to train up and fill those holes
* Sometimes, the answer is *"I know it sucks, but that's how it has to be"*
* Don't overuse the overeager just because they might be able to handle it
* Don't overburden the underutilized just because you want them to do more
* Remember that you are a part of the equation - some work will be yours to do, and some will be delegated. People respect leaders who hold their end of the rope
* In our field, more people on a task does not make the task more light! Keep that option in your pocket when the potential sharing of knowledge or innovation outweighs the detriments
* Just because someone has "always done it" or that a task has "always been done that way" doesn't mean that should continue. Find out why those things are the case, and see if those standards are born from laziness or lack of resources

## Conflict Management

Conflicts happen when people do anything with other people - you just have to expect it. Obviously, we would prefer that everyone gets along or at least handles their problems themselves; sometimes, though, it will fall to you to be a mediator. Sometimes, too, you will need to step in as a mediator when it becomes obvious that they can neither solve their own problems nor come to you for mediation of their own accord.

Mediation is when you have a neutral person hear both sides of the argument, determine what the problem is (much of the time, the *actual* problem isn't obvious to them), and find a way to satisfactorily resolve the problem for as many parties as possible. Two important things there: *neutral party*, the *problem is not always obvious*, and *resolved for as many parties as possible.*

As a *neutral party*, you cannot let your biases toward one person or group, or your thoughts about the situation as a whole, cloud your judgement or cause you to lose sight of each individual's right to feel how they feel. Acknowledging both sides and presenting the problem in as neutral, positive, and logical way possible will help put the problem into a context they couldn't arrive at themselves, as well as reenforcing your ability as a leader to remain fair and just when everyone else is emotional.

*The problem is not always obvious,* unfortunately, and will often fall to you do determine what people are even getting heated about. Much of the time, it will be obvious - someone did something wrong, but neither can agree how wrong or who is to blame. Sometimes, though, the "problem" being presented to you sounds like a petty difference of opinion, or something simple and overlookable by any standards. These are the problems that need to be unwound to find the real problem underneath. Someone has a problem they're not talking about; someone has more feelings about this than they're willing to admit. Find it, acknowledge it, even if you have to do it in private.

During mediation, we want to *satisfy as many parties as possible.* Naturally, sometimes someone is just not going to be satisfied; sometimes one person is just in the wrong; sometimes, the only person that can or must be satisfied is you. Take the time to pick apart the problem and what stake each person has in it, then compare the problem and the stress it's causing to the needs of the team as a whole. Who wins, and how many winners can we have by the end? Bonus question: what can you do to make the "losers" not feel like they lost?

Keep in mind - you will sometimes be one of the people with the problem! Exercise good leadership by attempting to be neutral, even to your own detriment. If you can't do that, seek another neutral mediator while you examine why you can't be neutral and unemotional in this case. The "I'm right because I said so" card is rarely correct, and in any case can't be used often lest you damage your reputation.

Steps to take during conflict resolution, as a mediator *or* a participant, include:

* Continually re-expressing the entirety of the problem in as simple terms as possible, whenever new information is found. This rephrasing and simplifying can help people see the whole context and impact rather than their narrow, biased view
* Looking for ways to identify and acknowledge emotions, then see if they are separable from the actual problem - sometimes, the problem *is* the emotions; other times, the problem is just made worse by them
* If all parties are amenable, have them try to think about the problem from the other person's point of view. This can be done as a guided exercise, or by you presenting each person's point of view in a sympathetic and un-emotional way, providing positive and negative points for both, if possible
* Asking point-blank *why* each person feels the way they do about the problem
* Asking point-blank what they want the outcome of this conflict to be, if any. Then, ask the other person if that outcome is acceptable or doable. Sometimes, the desired outcome is far less drastic than one or both parties expects, and so they resist resolution

## Decision-Making

Important, lasting, and sometimes controversial decisions will often fall to you as a leader and supervisor. This is a service and a faculty that you provide, and it's important that you recognize it as such because:

* It allows people to accept hard decisions because they weren't the one "to blame" for making it
* Your choices, as leadership, are seen as more permanent, and therefore have more merit
* You presumably have the experience and wisdom to provide the correct answer or opinion, which makes people feel better abot the outcome
* You save people from the stress of deliberation about topics or concerns they aren't prepared for (or don't care about)

Decision-making, while something that will often fall you to, is not a unilateral action. More often than not, asking the opinions of the people under and around you will provide you with more information than you had before, as well as help people to understand the situation and the decision(s) at hand better. Just by offering their opinion out loud, people often work through the difficulties they thought they had. Doing this also builds feelings of morale and empowerment when you're able to say "You're right - let's do it your way." You made the decision, technically, but they had already done all the work.

It's not possible to outline how decisions must be made, as each one will require different attentions, energies, and depths from you. The only things I can suggest are, as above, to collaborate with others, and to weigh everything in multiple scales. Many decisions will be easy and require no thought, but for those that do, weighing them on different scales can help to influence your decision into one that is more universally applicable and just.

Different decision making scales include:

* Does a decision even need to be made right now?
* Am I the one who needs to decide this?
* Will this decision affect the work? 
* Will it affect the team dynamic? 
* Should it be documented so that it carries forward? 
* Am I making the decision just to settle an argument?
* Am I undoing a decision made by someone else?
* Am I introducing something new and potentially unsettling?
* Is the decision temporary? When will it no longer be applicable?
* What is the range or the scope that this decision will affect?
* Who does this decision benefit, and to whom does it detriment?
* Do I just need to make a decision that no one likes and accept the consequences?

## Maintaining Order

Order must prevail! That sounds dramatic, like something a judge or fantasy character would say, but in essence that's the entire purpose of the hierarchical structure that put you where you are. It's not just about the lineage of power down a chain, it's that those in charge are individually responsible for enforcing order, culture, and personality to sometimes very subtle effect.

Order starts with you. If you obey the rules of those above you, respect and follow the rules you place on others, and act fairly and transparently, everyone around you is affected by that and will emulate those behaviors. If you decide to bend the rules, "go rogue," fail to make good decisions, have poor manners or work ethic, etc, guess what? People pick up on those things too.

**Stay on top of small transgressions before they become larger ones** - after all, silence is equivalent to acceptance. If you don't like something, address it. If a behavior could destroy team unity, address it. If your own behaviors favor yourself out of laziness or "power drunkenness" and you begin to see those behaviors in others, it's on you to self-correct. Lazy leaders breed lazy workers, and especially with junior employees, those lessons and expectations carry with them through their entire careers. 

## Defense From the Top

Choices you and your team make, as well as your performance (and, like, a thousand other things) can become targets for outside criticism. Something you do for the betterment of your team may have repurcussions that you will have to defend against; likewise, your team's output may be lacking, and it will be up to you to defend or correct this situation. 

To be clear: you don't get to throw anyone under the bus, because you're already there by default. Such is the burden of those in charge. To complete the analogy, your best course of action is to be a good enough leader that people will climb under the bus with you when you need them to.

While not an active every day part of your job, you will be thankful if you develop the following habits to prepare yourself for when you find yourself at the table:

* Have your team's back, but be fair and reasonable enough to know when the problem *is* the team or a team member
* Keep metrics wherever you can that shows stability, improvement, and growth
* Clear your potentially controversial or long-lasting decisions with your bosses *and* your team before making them
* Address small problems before they become large problems
* Develop a culture that shuns "us vs them" mentality - even though your team may be insular, creating artificial division with other teams or people will only bring unnecessary conflict and criticism
* Investigate complaints and potential problems promptly

Common problems that you will potentially have to go to bat, or stand trial, for include:

* An outside person keeps demanding work from your team when they have no right to because proper channels exist
* Your team's output is lacking, and is affecting other business processes
* Other teams get priority over resources, and that affects your ability to operate or grow
* Unreasonable expectations are placed on you or your team - this is likely the one you'll run into most, and will either be about unrealistic timelines, unrealistic metrics, or the team saying "no" in way that is viewed as rude or unprofessional
* A team member or subordinate did something legitimately harmful or wrong, and someone needs to explain why they did it
* A higher-up doesn't understand your team's purpose or how you work, and is treating you unfairly out of their ignorance
* Budgeting or cashflow means that layoffs need to happen, and you must choose who goes and who stays

In any case, your team should believe that you have their back, and should know that you'll correct them before any situation like that ever arises. Build the expectation of support and course correction, back up your performance and decisions with facts and metrics, and cover your ass when you need to by staying on top of everything that happens to your people, and making remediation plans *before* you're asked.

## Doing the Dirty Work

Along with helping grow others, the satisfaction of mediation, and the feeling of power and ownership coming together to bear fruit, leadership and supervision also gives you *the dirty work.* You cannot have one without the other, and your execution of both is what people will remember.

What do I mean by "dirty work?"

* Being the one to tell someone they smell bad
* Working on holidays to let everyone else have vacation
* Telling someone "too bad" when something isn't going their way
* Hearing about and dealing with heartbreaking or infuriating personal issues, emotions, and family problems
* Putting your own tasks on hold to help others
* Firings and lay-offs
* Facing judgement by outside forces for choices you made for the betterment of your team
* Concealing your own emotions or thoughts for the sake of team unity and peace
* Checking in on late or missing employees, not knowing how you'll find them
* Dealing with irate customers and other employees when it becomes too much for your subordinate to handle themselves

Those are all awkward, scary, undesireable things to go through, but you will need the strength and resolve to carry those burdens for the betterment of all. From experience, you will rarely get even one or two of them over the course of years, depending on how often you get new people, but you never know when they're going to pop up. Regular feedback, checking up on your people, addressing small things before they become large, and creating an environment of integrity and acceptance will help to soften or mitigate these and other problems. 

If all that worries you, remember that these are just human problems, and you can talk to someone about them. Just because you carry these burdens doesn't mean you can't talk about them with someone else - hell, your boss also has these responsibilities and has likely had to deal with them themselves. You help people, yes, but you are not an island. Create a support structure for yourself!






# Techniques {#techniques}

## I-Statements and We-Statements

A common technique in therapy, using *I-statements* instead of *you-statements* can help to make a potentially confrontational conflict less dramatic. Negative reactions often occur because of simply misinterpreting the words used to express a concern, observation, or a need, which prevents the listener from truly recieving the message those words are trying to convey. *You-statements* apply feelings of pressure and blame, which we naturally want to deflect or rebuke.

Additionally, the use of *we-statements* further softens conflicts by invoking a sense of belonging, where a *you-statement* singles the listener out from the group. *We* are better than this, and *you* are a part of *us.*

There is a time and place for *I*, *you*, and *we*, but know that how you frame your feedback can have subtle psychological effects. Combining this technology with overall more positive wording makes contentious situations go much smoother.

* *"You are doing it wrong"* becomes *"I know you could do it better"*
* *"You never listen"* becomes *"I feel like you don't listen to what I'm saying"*
* *"You aren't following standards"* becomes *"We have standards you should be following"*

## Would You Kindly?

You have two secret weapons that you've known since you were a child, but probably never linked with your career:

* Minding your manners
* Asking politely

Believe it or not, people are more likely to want to help, understand, or believe if you communicate politely, e.g. please, thank you, I appreciate it. More interesting is that phrasing commands as requests for favors or help can invoke a feeling of cooperation and free-will even though both parties know there really wasn't a choice on their part.

* "Would you mind doing me a favor? Could you look into that issue I just made? Thank you, I appreciate it!"
* "You know what would be helpful, now that I think of it? If you could look into that issue I just made, I can keep working on this other thing."
* "Thank you for doing that for me, I really appreciate it."

## Say It and It Will Be

Part of your job is to help your subordinates fight against uncertainty. Sometimes, uncertainty crops up in places where policy, history, and your experience have not yet tread - so what do you do? How do you make decisions in the moment about something you've never had to think about or deal with? 

Say it, and it will be. This is the power and the burden of leadership, that your words take root and last forever; but you can use that power to reenforce your legacy and the appearance that you know everything and always make the right call. 

Think about what you *want* to happen, double check it for holes, get a second opinion, then say it as a fact. Say it, and it will be. Sometimes, not often but sometimes, the solutions to problems weren't hard-earned, experientially-driven, wisdom-transference events - they're the result of a leader saying their dreams out loud as if they had always been true. If your statements are reasonable and just, your subordinates and team will live in that reality, and it will *be*.

Just be prepared for these new realities, because once you make them, you live in them forever.

## Provide Context

A lot of confusion and negative feelings come from something as simple as just not knowing or understanding the context in which decisions or comments are made. Providing context, backstory, history, insight into the process, and other establishing information helps your audience to better understand the holistic world in which you are coming from, but that they may not have been a part of. 

Being able to provide what feels like (or is) "insider info" also makes people feel special, like you're trusting them with the inner workings of a great machine they are mercifully kept from. These feelings of collaboration will encourage collaboration and sharing when it's *their* turn to provide context.

Additionally, providing a more complete picture of a scenario can spark ideas in people that you wouldn't have had, and is a great way to gain an instant collaborator.

## Personal Touches

Part of your role as a leader and mentor is passing on information to others so that they can benefit from your experience and history. This can provide context, as above, but doing so also acts as a vehicle for delivering subtle charismatic-leader-type information. These stories, examples, anecdotes, etc, show you doing the work, how you make decisions, what you've been through, and potentially how you earned your way to where you are.

Providing stories and context also helps you bond with your subordinates and team. You undoubtedly had to deal with the same problems they face now, and you have probably done some pretty cool things that will give them something to look forward to, or to strive toward.

## Dealing With Awkward Encounters

As the person that often has to deal with awkward encounters, it is important that you be comfortable with them. Or rather, that you be comfortable with your uncomfortableness. 

These kinds of situations will always be awkward no matter how many times you have to go through with them. They are awkward for you, and for the person or people you are speaking to, *forever*. There is no fancy psychology, no trick, except to accept that it *is* awkward, and that's okay.

Be honest, be sympathetic, be aware of the ridiculousness/awkwardness you're about to participate in, and don't belabor it too much. 

Thankfully, going through awkward, traumatic, or strange situations with another person can help build bonds and increase feelings of comeradery. Plus, the leader who is willing to tackle the awkward encounters with grace will be seen as a more empathetic and caring leader.

## In-Person Is Always Better (With Exceptions)

*Unless you need something to be documented in writing*, or need time to formulate your words, in-person communication is always better. Get out from under your desk and use your human mouth to speak with someone. 

In-person communications enable all participants to use all of their forms of language - verbal, physical, facial, gestures, etc - rather than just one. This can speed up communication, increase empathic feelings, and shortcut your ability to sense hesitation or gratitude.

## Fake It 'til You Make It

If that big list of leadership qualities seemed daunting to you, or if you don't feel like you're qualified for this role, you can trust me that no one is all of those things. No one is truly ready - and that's okay. You learn on the job, and the learning opportunities happen every hour, every interaction, every call, every email. Take them as they come, and don't be afraid to fake it 'til you make it.

After all, if you are purposefully "faking" being a gratious, charismatic, empathetic, and just person - what's the difference? The effect is the same, fake or not: graciousness, charisma, empathy, and justice.

One tool you can use if you're unsure how to act or what to choose: think about it from a hero's perspective. Tell yourself the story of the (potentially imaginary) time your mom had to comfort someone whose grandma just died, or how that favorite boss from your last job handled a subordinate who was always late. Depending on how well you know a person and how they made decisions or expressed their leadership, you will find that that wisdom was in you all along.

## Start At the Top

If you or someone you're talking to is having trouble describing or explaining something, have them either *start at the top* or *start at the bottom.* When things are complicated, or if they are not comfortable talking to you, or their emotions are high, it's easy to get wrapped up in the weight of the entire thing rather than just focusing on what's at hand. 

Starting somewhere, but particularly at the top or at the bottom gives a place to start from, a place to pull the thread, after which the rest will follow. 

*The top* is whatever came first in the history of what you're talking about: the first steps you took, the first converstion that happened, the issue or document or whatever that this is based on. Describing the start of events naturally makes it easier to talk about what happened next, then next, then next, etc.

*The bottom* is where you're at right now. What are you looking at right now? What is the current problem, the current solution or iteration? Describing the current situation makes it easier to say "this is because of this, which is because of this, which is because of this..."
